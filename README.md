# Ascom Alpacha Switch and Dome Board ESP32


Hello everyone, I use this firmware to open and close my Dome roof and is used olso for handle 6 switch.

Each two devices are recognized form ascom aplacha, no usb connectio or driver are needed to work, only http api comunication.

The switch are already tested with N.I.N.A!
Dome is already tested with Ascom device hub

It's a work in progess, but it's already tested with great stability!

WiFi Manager for first connection or connection to WiFi fail, automatic reconnection in case of disconnection (hoping for a router restart)

## Dome
Actually Ascom Dome function is tested with:

- Starkeepper Voyager Software
- Ascom Device Hub

My dome is R.O.R rolling roof, I used a gate motor, so I use just two output and two input:

- Start
- Halt
- Open Input
- Close Input

The start signal is HIGH just for one second

- If everything work as expected roof will open/close correcty
- In case of Worng direction (you want open but it going to close) the board send another Start signal (only one time avoiding ping pong), this can happen in case of shoutdown during roof is moving
- A timer look for a moviment timeout, if timeout occurred HALT signal is HIGH for 3 second.

## Switch

Actually Ascom Switch function is tested with:

- N.I.N.A.

6 Switch can be configurated as output or input, in near future I will implement olso pwm signal.

Error sended to ascom alpaca:

- "The Switch x doesn't exist", where x is the switch number, if x= -1 the parameters was not in the ascom alpaca request
- "The Value X is out of range MIN: Y MAX: Z" is coming if we are setting a value X outside the min and max value of that switch (ex. value 2 to a digital output)
- "The Value was not provided from ASCOM" in the coming request is missing value parameter

### History
