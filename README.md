# Ascom Alpacha Switch and Dome Board ESP32

Do you have a remote observatory? This board is made for you!
One in three Ascom copilant WiFi board is here!

- Dome controller (Only R.O.R)
- Switch Controller
- CoverCalibration (flat frame)

Each devices is recognized form Ascom via aplacha protocol, no usb connectio or driver are needed to work, just WiFi!

USB cable is required just for the first software download, after that a WiFi Manager will help you to connect the board on your WiFi (no way to use this board as AP).

Automatic WiFi reconnection in case of disconnection (hoping for a router restart)
OTA Update, to update the firmware without any cables.

## Dome
Dome support only R.O.R. type. You can use a normal gate board.
The board provide the signals:
- Move (open/close)
- Halt
And need back the shutter state:
- Open
- Close

Features:
- Cause gate boards han no direction, if the roof goes in the wrong direction, the board recognized it and send another command.
- Can be enable an auto close system that close the roof if there's no communication between board and ascom or pc (you can set how many minutes)
- Automatic fault detection if moviment don't finish within XX second (you can set your timeout seconds) 

## Switch

You can configure 16 Switch and they can be:
-Gauges
-Switch
-PWM signal
-Analog Input

A configuration page with validation is provided, so you don't need to handle the change the software by your self :D  
<code style="color : Red">You can't use Switch Output for any other device like Dome or CoverCalibrator!</code>

## CoverCalibration (aka Automatic Flat Panel)
You can have a PWM signlat to handle a mofset to encrease or decrease the flat panel brightness, for a bettere experience (avoid led flickering) you can command a led power supply with the PWM or a mofset
The CoverCalibrator is a must have to have perfect flat frame!


#### Changelog

ðŸ’¥ **3.0.0** - BREACKING NEWS! Now switch, calibrator and dome are modules, if you don't plan to use it, you can disable it!, the web page and the discovery will hide it for you. Also pin validation during the setup is better now
If you don't use a module you can comment the respective row at the beginning of the main.cpp:

`#define DOME`
`#define SWITCH`
`#define COVERC`

You don't use the dome?
`\\#define DOME`
`#define SWITCH`
`#define COVERC`

2.0.0 - Now all the board can be setupped by the browser. Dome I/O and Switch setting is now editable from the browser and you can save the confi files.
Before update write in a memo all your setting.
Web pages run now alpine.js and all the js under the hood is rewrited in a modern way.
Now Dome and switch are in the same page, olso settings now are in the same page!
New dome function: Auto Close if anyone is talking with the board (browser or ascom alpacha driver) [IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT], you can enable or disable this featur by browser setup page.


### ToDo List:
- Make Web Pages Translatable


# How to use

## First time board installation

First of all we need to install Visual Studio Code and add Platformio extension.

# Using the board with Ascom driver.

First of all we need to install the last Ascom platform (version 6 or higher) from here: https://ascom-standards.org/Downloads/Index.htm

Not every software as ex. NINA, open the Ascom Device Selector, and the board cannot be founded, in this case we need to crate a new ascom dynamic driver:

Open ASCOM Diagnostic:

Pin Start is the pin used to give the start to the motor
Pin Halt is used to stop the motor

Pin Shutter Open should be ON when the shutter is Open
Pin Shutter Close  should be ON when the shutter is Closed

The board does not allow having both inputs active.

~~Enable closing in case of missing connection - If selected the shutter will be closed in ascom don't talk with the board within xxx minutes (computer crash safety)~~ not developed yet

Save you store the configuration on the board
Download Configurazione - you can download the Dome configuration for backup.


### Switch Section

Here you can setup all the Pin you want to use (MAX 16)

You can give a name and a description (max lenght 32)

You can choose the type of the switch (Input, Output, PWM or analog input)

According to the esp32 datashet be sure of wich pin you want to use or you can you can run into problems, **any valditation rules are developed for the moment!**
Read this article: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-pinout-reference-gpios/
If you need a PCB you can use a mine one: https://github.com/StefanoTesla/esp32-kraken as you can see the pin signed with S are Safe to use, and with the I the Imput only pin.
From pin 16 to 33 are safe to use, pin 34 35 36 and 39 are input only.
**Don't set pin from 6 to 11, you will brick the board!**
All the PWN singals are automatically setted up with a range from 0 to 8192.

Save to store modification.
**If you change the pin number or type, it will not work until a board reboot.++
